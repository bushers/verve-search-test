## Verve Search Test - Task One

To get the project running on your local machine:
1. Clone the GitHub repo
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run start` or `yarn start` to start the local dev server

Please note the localserver will run on port 3000. This is also where the JSON data is being fetched from. If changing the port, the fetch url will need to be updated.

I realise that the test is not perfect and there are things that can be improved. However I wanted to give a realistic representation of my current skill level given a reasonable time frame.

I spent roughly 3-4 hours on the test.
